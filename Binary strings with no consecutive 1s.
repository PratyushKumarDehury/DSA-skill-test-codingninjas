You have been given an integer K.
Your task is to generate all binary strings of length K such that there are no consecutive 1s in the string. 
This means that the binary string should not contain any instance of 1’s coming one after another.
A binary string is that string which contains only ‘0’ and ‘1’.
For Example:
Let ‘K=3’, hence the length of the binary string would be 3. We can have the following binary strings with no consecutive 1s:
000 001 010 100 101 
Note
1. Each string must be a binary string.
2. There should be no consecutive ‘1’ in the string.
3. Return an array/sequence of all the strings in an array in a lexicographically increasing order.
Input format:
The first line of input contains ‘T’ the number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer K denoting the length of the binary string to be generated.
Output Format
For each test case, print all possible binary strings without consecutive ‘1’ of the length K in lexicographically increasing order. 
Note:
You don't need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
0 <= K <= 22

Time limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:

4
3
Sample Output 1:
0000 0001 0010 0100 0101 1000 1001 1010 
000 001 010 100 101 
Explanation of sample input 1:
Test case 1:

For K = 4 we get the following Strings:

0000 0001 0010 0100 0101 1000 1001 1010 

Note that none of the strings has consecutive 1s. Also, note that they are in a lexicographically increasing order.

Test case 2:

We can see that for K = 3 we get the following Strings:

000 001 010 100 101

Note that none of the strings has consecutive 1s. Also, note that they are in a lexicographically increasing order.
